## Detailed Instructions:

1. **Create the HTML Structure**:

   - Set up the basic HTML structure with a `header`, `main`, and `footer`.

4. **Style the Footer**:

   - Use relative positioning to place the contact information appropriately.
   - Ensure the footer remains at the bottom of the page and adapts to different screen sizes.

5. **Implement Media Queries**:

   - Write media queries to adjust the layout for mobile devices (e.g., max-width: 600px).
   - Test the website on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

6. **Test and Validate**:
   - Validate your HTML and CSS using online validators.

## Deploying with GitHub Pages:

   - Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Select the branch you want to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Save your settings.
